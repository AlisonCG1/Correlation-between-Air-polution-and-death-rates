**Summary**
Air pollution is a silent problem that affects people’s health. This project analyses the level of air pollutants focused on PM (Particulate Matter). The datasets used are from NASA this dataset contains overall population rates and particulate matter per million. Between 2003 and 2016 and the World Health Organization this dataset contains death rates caused by particulate matter and cause of death. This research uses R as the main tool to clean the data and run the analyses. 


# **Motivation**

The motivation behind this analysis is to bring awareness to this problem. Different sources prove how air pollution is responsible for the death of millions of people per year. Although this project only focuses on the level of pollutants vs death rates.


## **Data dictionary:**
Particulate matter (PM): A mix of particles in the air.  Some of those particles are visible as smoke or dust. Others are much smaller and we can not see them. “Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks, or fires.

Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of complex reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industries, and automobiles” United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Death rates: In this dataset only corresponds to deaths caused by particulate matter.

## **Methodology**
This dataset was approached by counting the top 10 countries with major levels of particulate matter. The models compare Particulate matter per country, and death rates caused by particulate matter. Furthermore, it also compares death rates per continent and the most common deaths per continent.
